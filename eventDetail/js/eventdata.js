At the conclusion of each One-on-One Match, the winner will be decided by the\nfollowing criteria:\n<ul>\n<li> <b>Penalty Due to Rules Violation:</b> If Referee believes that one Team's Bot\nwas violating a Tournament Rule, they will inform Robosapiens officials, who may\nthen declare the opposing Team the winner by Penalty. The Penalty can be declared\neither during or immediately following the Match.</li>\n<li> <b>Knock-Out Due to Engagement Avoidance:</b> If a Referee believes that an\nOperator is deliberately avoiding the engagement of their Bot with the opponent Bot,\nthe Referee will notify that Operator that their robot must make physical contact with,\nor otherwise engage the opponent Bot. If the Operator does not try to comply, the\nReferee may declare that the Operator's Team has lost due to a Knock-Out.</li>\n<li> <b>Single Incapacitation Knock-Out:</b> During a Match, a Bot must at any time\nbe able to demonstrate that it is Responsive. This is confirmed as follows:</lo>\n<ul><li> At any time and for any reason, a Referee can request that a Team's\nOperators show that their Bot is Responsive.</li>\n<li> After the request, the Referee will start a count-down from 20 (of which the\nfinal 10 counts will be called out loud) for the Operators to demonstrate that the\nBot can exhibit controlled translational movement.</li>\n<li> If the Bot cannot demonstrate that it is Responsive before the end of the\ncount-down, it will be declared Incapacitated.</li></ul>\nIf one Team's Robot becomes Incapacitated, then the opponent Team will be declared\nthe winner. The win will be considered a Knockout. The Referees' decision about\nwhen an Incapacitated Bot is considered Knocked Out shall be final and not subject\nto challenge or appeal.\n<li> <b>Referee's Determination of Match Winner:</b> Certain criteria and methods\nare used by the Referee to decide a Match winner in the event a winner is not\ndetermined during a Match (i.e., neither Robot is Incapacitated,\nKnocked Out, Disqualified, etc. during the duration of the Match). In case <b>PSSC (Point System Scoring Criteria)</b> is used to decide the winner, <b>5 minutes </b>will be given time for the fight. </li>\n</ul>\n2. <b>Points System Scoring Criteria</b> - The scoring criteria uses various factors, each of which is assigned a point value, as follows:\n<ul>\n<li>+100 points - Match winner</li>\n<li>+50 points - Knock-out opponent's bot from arena. (In such cases 10 seconds will be given to opponent to place the robot back to arena if robot can fight any further)</li>\n<li>+50 points - PCB modifications (Allotted by judge panel out of 50)</li>\n<li>+20 points - for each part separated from opponent's robot</li>\n<li>+15 points - Mechanism/Designs used in robots (Allotted by the judge out of 15)</li>\n<li>+10 points - for each component damaged (parts stopping to work) during combat</li>",
