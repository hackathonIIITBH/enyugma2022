The Penalty can be declared\neither during or immediately following the Match.</li>\n<li> <b>Knock-Out Due to Engagement Avoidance:</b> If a Referee believes that an\nOperator is deliberately avoiding the engagement of their Bot with the opponent Bot,\nthe Referee will notify that Operator that their robot must make physical contact with,\nor otherwise engage the opponent Bot.
